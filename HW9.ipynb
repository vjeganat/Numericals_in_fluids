    "Pressure in the incompressible flow makes the code non-localized. In compressible flow, the information of pressure travels a particular speed (the one corresponds to the wave of sound). It is to be noted that the speed of sound is infinite in incompressible flow, making the information travel infinitely fast. This leads to using techniques like pseudo-time to capture the characteristics in incompressible flow"
